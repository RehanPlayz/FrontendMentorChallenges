## My process

### Built with

- Well Structured HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first approch workflow

### What I learned

Through this project I've learned mobile-fisrt design approch, working style of CSS flexbox and a little bit of grid system and their properties and obviously image blend mode as well. Most important fact, I want to mention that rem is better than percentage or viewport measurement.

To center any element inside a section you can add code snippet, see below:

```css
section {
  display: gird;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In future I will try to learn more about image positioning in any particular section.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to blend image with the background color. I really like this docs and will use it going forward.
